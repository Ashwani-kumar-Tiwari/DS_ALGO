Dynamic Programming :- sacrifice with space and save massive time and to solve repetited problems.

Tabulation :-
    1. Make Storage.
    2. Assign meaning to cell -> dp[i] have fib(i) i.e. dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    3. Identify traversal(smallest problem to larget problem) of problem.
    4. Set prerequisite in DP(Dynamic Programming).
